[Querying Datasets](./querying-data/querying-datasets.md) shows you how to search data from any dataset (Core or private) using our Query Data endpoint. It's simple: enter a `key` value and then optionally specify any time range or constraints you like.

[Querying Datasets with iex.js](./querying-data/querying-datasets-with-iexjs.md) makes querying even easier by leveraging a simple client library for JavaScript developers. It's open source too.

[Batch Data Queries](./querying-data/batch-data-queries.md) demonstrates searching multiple keys in multiple datasets. It's a great way to get lots of data in one query.

<!--[SQL Query with the API](./querying-data/sql-query-with-the-api.md) demonstrates searching datasets using full-on SQL queries.-->
