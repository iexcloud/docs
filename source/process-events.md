Apperate's Rules Engine uses event-based rules to process events and push alerts and data from IEX Cloud. With the click of a button, you can schedule data delivery and notifications to be sent via SMS, email, webhooks, and more when conditions of your choice are met across IEX Cloud datasets.  

Rules Engine helps you get data delivered how and when you need it: 

- **No coding required.** Deliver data through a simple dashboard where you can configure your alerts with the click of a button. 

- **Custom delivery.** Configure precise conditions for when you want data sent, choosing from a range of delivery mechanisms such as SMS, email, webhook, Slack, and more.  

- **Complex use cases made easy.** Incorporate multiple datasets and conditions into your rules. 

- **Store data without setting up servers.** Automatically save data to logs on IEX Cloud without setting up any storage infrastructure. 

This product is currently in beta for all paid IEX Cloud customers and is subject to changes as we iterate based on feedback. Please let us know if you experience unexpected behavior by emailing <support@iexcloud.io>.

## Some Use Cases 

Rules Engine helps make financial data more accessible for technical and non-technical users alike. While the functionality has a variety of applications, here are several important use cases: 

**Get data without technical setup:** Instead of setting up API requests, you can configure a series of rules through our simple dashboard. For instance, you can configure Rules Engine to send you minute-by-minute price data as itâ€™s available throughout the day. 

**Easily filter for complex conditions across a range of datasets:** Layer and combine conditions into a single rule. For instance, send yourself an SMS when a given stock has a market cap over $200B and has an intraday price change of over 3%.  

**Use messages more efficiently:** Rather than continuously querying data to monitor whether a specific event has occurred, such as earnings being released for a given company, you can now use Rules Engine to trigger a notification for you. Rules Engine not only saves you messages but also development time and effort.  

**Store data on IEX Cloud without creating your own infrastructure:** Automatically save data to logs on IEX Cloud directly, rather than maintaining your own storage infrastructure. Coming soon: Use our API to access your data at any time.
