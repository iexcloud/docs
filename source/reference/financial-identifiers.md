# Securities Identifiers

If an indexed dataset property is opted in IEX Cloud's metadata graph, Apperate normalizes the property's values with the following securities (financial) identifiers. The opted in property uses Apperate [SmartLinks](./glossary.md#smartlink).

``` {note} A dataset property can be opted in to the metadata graph automatically by Apperate during dataset creation or by a user manually via the Schema Editor or an API call.
```

**Supported securities identifiers:**
