We are limited to what our data provider, New Constructs, covers. While our **fundamentals** coverage includes over 90% of the total U.S. equity market by market cap, including data for the top `2,500` U.S. stock, note that certain small-cap stocks are not covered with our financial statement endpoints.
Additionally, we currently only support Fundamentals data for Class A shares. You can utilize our Financials as Reported endpoint that returns rawÂ financial data reported in 10-K and 10-Q filings.
