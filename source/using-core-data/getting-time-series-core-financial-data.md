# Get Historical IEX Cloud Core Financial Data

```{important} Apperate includes only historical time series Core Data at this time. We are in the process of migrating real-time legacy data, including stock quotes, into Apperate. In the meantime, please see the [Legacy API Reference](https://iexcloud.io/docs/api/) for the real-time legacy data.
```

Apperate's Core Datasets provide historical time series financial data. Let's call an endpoint to get this financial data.

**Prerequisites:**

- **IEX Cloud Apperate account** - Create one [here](https://iexcloud.io/cloud-login#/register).
- **Apperate workspace** - See [Creating a Workspace](../getting-started/getting-started-with-apperate.md#create-a-workspace). 

## Steps

Here are steps for getting this core financial data.

1. Browse the Core Datasets in the console at [**Data &rarr; Datasets &rarr; Core**](https://iexcloud.io/console/datasets/core). The Core Datasets list appears.

    ![](./getting-time-series-core-financial-data/core-datasets.png)

    ``` {hint} If there are grayed-out datasets you want to use, upgrade your plan. To upgrade, click one of the grayed-out datasets and click the **Upgrade** button that appears. Otherwise, upgrade your plan at **Account** &rarr; [**Manage Plan**](https://iexcloud.io/console/manage-plan).
    ```

1. Click on the dataset you want data from. For example, if you want to get cash flow records, click the CASH_FLOW dataset. The dataset overview appears.

    ``` {note} From a dataset's **Database** page, you can query its data, export the query results to a CSV, and share your query in a URL. 
    ```
    
1. Examine the the **Example Request** URL.

    ```
    https://WORKSPACE.iex.cloud/v1/data/CORE/CASH_FLOW?last=1&token=TOKEN
    ```

    Here's a breakdown of the URL.

    | URL Component | Description |
    | --- | --- |
    | `https://WORKSPACE.iex.cloud/v1` | Base URL consisting of the domain (your workspace is the subdomain) and the API version. |
    | `/data/CORE/CASH_FLOW` | The Data API's [`GET /data/` method](https://iexcloud.io/docs/apperate-apis/data/get-data) followed by path parameter values `CORE` for the dataset namespace and `CASH_FLOW` for the dataset ID. |
    | `?last=1&token=TOKEN` | Method parameters `last=1` to return the last record and `token=TOKEN` to authorize access. Please see the [`GET /data/` method](https://iexcloud.io/docs/apperate-apis/data/get-data) reference for additional parameters. See [Security and Access](../administration/access-and-security.md) to create public access tokens. |

1. Get the latest record by clicking the **Example Request** URL. Apperate opens the request in a new browser tab and the A JSON array appears in the response like this:

    ```javascript
    [
        {
            "capitalExpenditures": -153981933.26019996,
            "cashChange": 52921982765.789,
            "cashFlow": -7635540477.244902,
            "cashFlowFinancing": 804800407.0185003,
            "changesInInventories": 0,
            "changesInReceivables": 0,

            "dividendsPaid": null,

            "fiscalQuarter": 3,

            "investments": null,

            "netIncome": 1956976221.5984,
            "otherFinancingCashFlows": null,
            "reportDate": "2022-08-23",
            "symbol": "BNS",
            "totalInvestingCashFlows": 5990703186.795099,
            "id": "CASH_FLOW",
            "key": "BNS",
            "subkey": "quarterly",
            "date": 1659225600000,
            "updated": 1661439879000
        }
    ]
    ```

    ```{note} The response will be different for you because records are continuously being added.
    ```

1. Update the URL to get Apple's latest cash flow record: add the `AAPL` symbol as a path parameter (the `key` path parameter) after `CASH_FLOW` and replace `WORKSPACE` and `TOKEN` with your values.

    ```
    https://WORKSPACE.iex.cloud/v1/data/CORE/CASH_FLOW/AAPL?last=1&token=TOKEN
    ```

    A JSON array appears in the response like this:

    ```javascript

        }
    ]
    ```

    ``` {important} key and subkey path parameters are restricted to primary and secondary indexes, respectively. For more information on the Unique Index components, see [Understanding Datasets](../managing-your-data/understanding-datasets.md#indexing-with-unique-index).
