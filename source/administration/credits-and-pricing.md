Our pricing now operates a lot like other cloud database tools. It’s also designed to be one-to-one with how much you use the system, without complex if-this-then-that calculations. 

## How Credits Work

One credit equates to any of the following: 

- **1 GB of storage** - storage of your data and your indexes, including your [Unique Index](../reference/glossary.md#unique-index) components: primary, secondary, and date indexes.

    ``` {admonition} Free Storage through October 2022
    :class: important

    Storage is free through October 2022.
    ```
- **1 million reads**\* 
- **1 million writes or updates**
- **10 GB of data transfer out** – that's for any data transferred out of Apperate. It doesn't matter which dataset you're transferring from – it can be 10 GB of fundamentals data, 10 GB of stock data, or 10 GB of your own data that you're storing in Apperate.

**You also get 5+ TB of Core Data,** curated in Apperate by IEX Cloud. See [Production-Ready IEX Cloud Core Data](../getting-started/production-ready-core-data.md).

There are three plans: [Launch, Grow, and Scale](https://iexcloud.io/pricing/). Each offers a usage-based payment structure and comes with a starting monthly rate. At the end of each month, you receive a bill for the credits you used; at a minimum you are charged your plan's monthly rate. 

\* *Unlike other cloud databases that charge based on table scans and/or data blocks, a read on Apperate equates to getting a **whole** record/row.*

``` {hint} If there are grayed-out datasets you want to use, upgrade your plan. To upgrade, click one of the grayed-out datasets and click the **Upgrade** button that appears. Otherwise, upgrade your plan at **Account** &rarr; [**Manage Plan**](https://iexcloud.io/console/manage-plan).
```

## Go Month-to-Month or Annual (And Get a 37% Discount)

You can get the flexibility of month-to-month billing, or get a 37% discount for an annual minimum use commitment.

### Added Benefits of New Annual Plans vs Legacy Annual Plans 

With our new annual billing, you don't pay for usage until you pass your minimum use commitment anytime throughout the year. Upgrading to our new annual plans gives you an added benefit compared to our legacy annual plans, where unused credits expire at the end of each month.
